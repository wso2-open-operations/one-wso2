              perspective and would render its rail around a MIS screen.

              All four screens are routed, and each joined the registry in the

              child of a group whether or not it carries a path, so an entry
              without one is a row that silently does nothing.

              Access is NOT enforced here: MisShell asks useMisGate, so typing a
              URL you may not use gives a legible locked state rather than a
              redirect that leaves the reader guessing.

              ARR Analysis is the one exception, and it is a different question.
              `productsUsageEnabled` decides whether that screen EXISTS rather
              than who may read it, so with the flag off its route redirects to
              ARR Build — see MisArrAnalysisPage, which holds the redirect
