  //
  // It especially cannot fall through to `sectionAllowed`. MIS privilege 987

  // NAMES of its two admin Asgardeo groups on /subscriptions/meta-info and
  // leaves the comparison against the caller's own groups to the client,
  // because it has no `/me` of its own. So the gate here is a join of that

  // service under Me, manage-on-behalf under People Ops), which is why the ids
  // are gated by SUBSCRIPTION_ITEM_IDS rather than by where they appear.
  // `userInfo` is the SAME call `caps` above already makes (people-app's
  // /user-info), so this piggybacks on an existing fetch rather than adding
  // one: no new request, just one more field read off a response already in
  // flight for every perspective. While it's unresolved, `workLocation` reads
  // as undefined and this returns false — the same fail-closed-while-loading
  // behaviour `caps`-gated items already get from `capabilitiesFromPrivileges`
  // defaulting privileges to `[]`, so a gate is never mistakenly satisfied
  // just because its data hasn't landed yet.
  //
  // Beyond that: the self-service screen is open to every Sri Lanka employee —
  // opting yourself in and out is not an HR-team action, which is why it needs
  // no subscriptionGate fetch and works on Me where the gate is not enabled.
  // Only the manage-on-behalf screen ALSO needs a group, and it stays hidden

  // it a moment later reads as the rail flickering, and failing CLOSED is the
