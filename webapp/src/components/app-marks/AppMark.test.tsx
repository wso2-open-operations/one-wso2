   * perspective's PR on it would be the wrong coupling — the launcher falls back
   * to that perspective's line glyph until someone draws it a mark.

   * has been BUILT, not on what is currently released, so a perspective held
   * back by a preview flag (see perspectives.ts's `umt` entry) must not read as
   * a dead tone here the way an unauthored mark would.
