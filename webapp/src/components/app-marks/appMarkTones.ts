/**
 * Three tones per app mark, derived from the perspective's identity hue.
 *
 * The hue itself is not repeated here — it is `PERSPECTIVE_HUES[key].hue` in
 * @config/perspectiveHues, and `lead` below is that exact value. What this file
 * adds is the two supporting tones a two-colour mark needs.
 *
 *   field   the large ground shape (house body, wallet body, buoy ring)
 *   lead    the identifying form, at full saturation (roof, flap, spokes)
 *   detail  the small dark accent (door, clasp, handle)
 *
 * Precomputed rather than mixed at runtime, following perspectiveHues.ts: values
 * that can be read and asserted beat values that can only be observed.
 *
 * CONTRAST, and the one place this deliberately does not reach 3:1.
 *
 * `lead` and `detail` both clear the WCAG 1.4.11 non-text floor against a white
 * tile AND against the dark tile (3.02-5.79:1 across all ten pairs; the test
 * recomputes them). `field` does not: it measures 1.70-1.88:1 on white.
 *
 * That is not an oversight and it cannot be fixed by darkening. 1.4.11 applies to
 * what is *required to identify* the control, which here is the silhouette plus
 * the saturated `lead` form — both of which pass. `field` is interior modelling.
 * Darkening it until it passed was tried: every hue needs so much darkening that
 * `field` and `lead` end up 1.05-1.37:1 apart, which reads as one flat colour and
 * destroys the two-tone the marks exist for. A two-tone mark on a white ground
 * cannot have both tones dark; that is a property of the goal, not of the values.
 *
 * `detail` is mixed 18% black rather than a deeper 30%: at 30% it dropped to
 * 2.40-2.98:1 against the tile, and the megaphone's handle is a `detail` shape
 * that touches the tile ground rather than sitting inside another shape.
