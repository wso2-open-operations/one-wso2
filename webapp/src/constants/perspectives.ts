  // Two non-obvious things about this entry:
  //  - `access` controls whether the WAFFLE offers the perspective; `path` is
  //    what lets PerspectiveProvider recognise the route and give the perspective
  //    its own rail. BOTH are needed — `access` without `path` yields a tile that
  //    looks clickable and does nothing (WaffleOverlay bails on the click), and
  //    `path` without `access` makes it reachable by URL but unadvertised.
  //  - Its rail gates on the MARKETING OPS backend's own Asgardeo groups, not on
  //    people-app privileges — see useMarketingOpsGate and the wiring in
  //    SideRail. The `requires` on these sections is a coarse hint only.
