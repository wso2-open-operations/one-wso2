// The employee-facing half of par-app, surfaced inside the Me perspective —
// completing and sharing your own PAR is something every employee does for
// themself, same rationale as Leave and Claims. The Lead Portal (reviewing
// and rating *other people's* PAR) stays under People Ops — see
// docs/ported-apps/par-app.md and docs/ported-apps/claim-approval.md for the
// same split applied to claim approval.
