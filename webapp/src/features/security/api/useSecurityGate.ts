// Decides what the rail and the overview show.
//
// DELIBERATELY BUILT ON THE LIFTED HOOKS rather than a fresh query. They are
// what the lifted screens' own PrivilegeGuards consult, so composing them here
// means the rail and the pages cannot disagree about who may see what. A
// separate implementation would be a second copy of the access rule in the
// browser, which is how the two drift.
//
// The cost is inherited, and it is real:
//   - the three hooks fire GET /me/privileges separately, so a Security page
//     load makes three identical calls
//   - each caches in a module-level promise that is NOT keyed on the user, so
//     signing out and back in as someone else in the same tab can serve the
//     previous user's decision until a reload. The audit one is the strict
//     case: it never clears its promise at all, so it caches the first user's
//     answer for the tab's whole lifetime
//   - a failed call resolves to an empty privilege set, making a gateway
//     timeout indistinguishable from "you have no grants"
//
// Those are the source's behaviour today, running in production. Reproducing
// them is the point of lifting; fixing them here would be a rewrite by another
// name, and would put this app's answer out of step with the screens'.

  // useCurrentUser (not a fresh query) is the SAME hook the Evidence pages
  // call for their own admin/engineer UI — sharing it, rather than a second

  // WSO2's access token directly (see its own comment) rather than through
  // `registerAuth`, because this gate runs on every Security page — long
