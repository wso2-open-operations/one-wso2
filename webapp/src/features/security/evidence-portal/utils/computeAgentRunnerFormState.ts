/**
 * Works out what the Agent Runner's run form should look like: whether the
 * prompt can be typed into, what the primary button offers and whether it's
 * enabled, whether Advanced settings can be touched, and what the panel
 * below a result offers. Plain data in, plain data out — no React, no
 * knowledge of how any of this is drawn.
 *
 * Used to be five separate ad hoc checks against two booleans ("a task is
 * running", "a task has finished"), each restated at its own call site in
 * AgentRunner.tsx, roughly ten of them. Pulled out here so the rule for each
 * lives in one place — see ticket chala2001/grc-tools#138.
 *
 * Deliberately does not cover the effects that poll the Agent Task and
 * subscribe to its live updates. Those decide whether to keep talking to
 * the backend, not what the form looks like, and stay exactly as they were.
