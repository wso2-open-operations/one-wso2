/**
 * Turns the text of a CSV export into the Controls it describes.
 *
 * Reads `Control Number` and `Control Description from PY Report`, and
 * discards the rest of the file's columns. Descriptions in the real export
 * carry line breaks and commas inside quoted cells, so this hands the whole
 * text to papaparse rather than splitting on commas or newlines by hand,
 * which would corrupt those rows silently.
 *
 * A row missing either column's value can't become a Control, so it is
 * counted in `unusableRowCount` rather than returned, and so is a second row
 * repeating a reference the file has already described. Every row that clears
 * that bar gets a title: the first sentence of its description, cut at a
 * word boundary and given a trailing ellipsis once it runs past
 * `TITLE_LIMIT` characters. That guarantee, that no row ever needs a human
 * to write its title by hand, is what lets a hundred-row file become a
 * hundred Controls in one pass.
 *
 * Plain data in, plain data out: no DOM, no network, nothing about where
 * the text came from or where the rows are going.
