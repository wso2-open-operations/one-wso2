/**
 * Keeps an evidence screenshot's `<img src>` stable across refetches, so the
 * browser can reuse the picture it already downloaded instead of fetching it
 * again under a new URL.
 *
 * The backend signs a fresh Azure SAS URL every time it serializes evidence
 * (`backend/app/schemas/evidence.py`) — different signature, different `se=`
 * expiry, on every single response, even when the underlying blob has not
 * changed. That is correct and deliberate (ADR 0003: short-lived signed
 * links, no proxy route), but it means the browser has no way to tell two
 * signings of the same picture apart, so it re-downloads it every time.
 *
 * The fix has to live somewhere that outlives a single render, because the
 * whole point is to keep returning the *previous* render's URL. A
 * module-level `Map` does that: it survives refetches and remounts for as
 * long as the tab is open, which is exactly the lifetime we want.
 *
 * The map is keyed on the URL's **path**, not its file id or its full
 * string. The path is the blob's identity — it's the one part of a SAS URL
 * that a re-signing never changes. (Keying on an id instead is tempting but
 * wrong here: `EvidenceList.tsx`'s `galleryFiles` synthesizes a fallback
 * entry whose `id` is an *Evidence* id, not an *EvidenceFile* id, so two
 * different id spaces could collide in one map. A blob path can't collide.)
 *
 * A stored URL is handed back as long as its own `se=` expiry is more than
 * `MIN_REMAINING_MS` in the future. That slack exists so a URL just handed
 * to `<img>` can't expire while the request is still in flight — once a
 * link gets within two minutes of expiring, the fresh one takes over.
