 *
 * A step is flagged when any form of a changing verb appears anywhere in it.
 * That deliberately includes ordinary capture prompts that merely name a
 * delete policy or an update history: they raise the banner, the Engineer
 * ticks the box once, and nothing is ever refused. See the comment on
 * CHANGING_VERB_GROUPS above for why that trade is the right way round.
 *
 * A step matching more than one group reports the first group in table
 * order, because the banner only needs to say what kind of change it saw,
 * not enumerate every one.
 *
 * Plain data in, plain data out — no React, no knowledge of how any of this
 * is drawn.
