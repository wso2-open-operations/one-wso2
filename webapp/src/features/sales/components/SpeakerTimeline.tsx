/**
 * Who spoke, when, and how much — one track per person under the recording.
 *
 * The question it answers is "who dominated this call", which on a sales call is a
 * read on whether the customer was engaged or talked at. A share of talk time answers
 * that at a glance in a way a transcript never does.
 *
 * ONE HUE PER SPEAKER, from a fixed order, measured rather than judged.
 *
 * The palette validator was run over the categorical ramp for this chart's own pairlist.
 * These are stacked, individually labelled tracks, so a reader compares each row with its
 * NEIGHBOURS -- the adjacent pairlist, the same case as bars and stacks. All eight slots
 * pass there in both modes (worst adjacent CVD ΔE 9.1 light / 8.4 dark; worst
 * normal-vision ΔE 19.6 / 19.3). Three light-mode hues sit below 3:1 against the surface,
 * which the relief rule permits given a visible direct label on every row -- which this has.
 *
 * (The stricter all-pairs list, for interleaved marks like scatter, fails past three
 * slots. It does not apply here: the rows never overlap.)
 *
 * Colour follows the SPEAKER, not their rank. Rows are sorted loudest-first, so keying
 * colour off row order would repaint everyone whenever the ordering changed; it is keyed
 * off first appearance in the transcript instead, which is stable.
 *
 * Past eight speakers hues stop being assigned and a neutral is used, rather than
 * generating a ninth. Nothing is lost: the row's label already names the person.
