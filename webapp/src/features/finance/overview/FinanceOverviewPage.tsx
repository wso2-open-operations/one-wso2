 * Finance → Overview. Used to be a rail group that expanded into separate
 * rows per dashboard, each its own click before you reached it. This is the
 * one screen the rail now sends you to; the dropdown does the switching that
 * used to be a second click in the sidebar.
 *
 * No header of its own — the dropdown TAKES THE PLACE of whichever
 * dashboard's own eyebrow chip would show, via `FinanceShell`'s `actions`
 * slot (see `headerActions` below; `FinanceShell` renders `actions ?? <Chip
 * .../>`, never both) — the dropdown already says which section is showing,
 * so the chip would only repeat it.
 *
 * No dashboard changed to get here — each is still the exact same
 * default-exported page (own eyebrow chip, title, config-gating, loading and
 * error states), just chosen by the dropdown instead of a route. Both
 * `OpdDashboardScreen` and `ExpenseDashboardScreen` still enforce their own
 * finance-approver role check internally, so someone without it sees that
 * screen's own notice, not a missing option.
