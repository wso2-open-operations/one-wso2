// A Build table, described as a sheet.
//
// ADR 0004 lists an export path as required scope rather than a caveat: a
// hand-rolled `<table>` gets none of the select-and-paste a data grid gives
// free, and that paste IS Finance's existing workflow.
//
// ---- the one thing this must not do ----------------------------------------
//
// `BuildTable`'s cells are already formatted — `BuildCell.text` is what
// `formatMisValue` returned, so at Scale "Values in '000" it is a figure
// already divided by a thousand, written as a string with separators in it.
// An export that walked the table would inherit both, and spec §10.18 is the
// rule against exactly that: "a finance export that is silently 1000x wrong is
// worse than no export at all, because it is believed."
//
// Both halves are real, and the second is not hypothetical either — the
// source's own Flash workbook has it. `generateAnnualSheet.js` writes
// `formatNumber(item.iam)` into every figure cell, which is a STRING, so a
// column of figures in the file Finance opens today cannot be summed.
//
// So this builder reads the RAW figures and never the table's text, and it
// takes no Scale parameter at all. There is no argument a caller could pass the
// reader's thousands setting through, which makes the rule structural rather
// than documentary — the same shape `formatMisValue` uses for the same rule.
//
// (Ticket 18 extended this for the Flash's workbook; ticket 18's Flash work
// was removed when the Flash Dashboard was kept in the MIS app — ADR 0005 —
// and only its percentage rule, below, stayed.)
