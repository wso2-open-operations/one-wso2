// The customers behind one figure, as a sheet.

// Ticket 10 carried this here. The source's dialog has an Export CSV button
// (`ArrSummaryCustomersDialog.js:191-216`) that ticket deliberately did not
// port: a bespoke CSV in the dialog would have been exactly the second export
// path this ticket exists to prevent. So the dialog is a consumer of the same
// builders as the Build.
//
// It is a `misBuildSheet` with no Periods in it — the same degenerate case the
// dialog already renders `BuildTable` in, hitting the same code rather than a
// branch beside it.
