// A workbook, described as data, and the one place that turns such a
// description into bytes.
//
// ---- why a spec, rather than a function that builds a workbook -------------
//
// The source's export is a single function that opens ExcelJS, walks the grid
// and writes cells in the same breath (`arrDashboard/utils/excelExport.js`).
// Nothing in it can be tested: asserting on the workbook means running ExcelJS,
// and running ExcelJS means having a real grid to walk. So its formatting has
// never been checked by anything but a reader opening the file.
//
// Splitting it in two fixes that. A `MisWorkbookSpec` is plain data — which
// sheets, which rows, which number formats — so the builders that produce one
// are pure functions over the figures a screen already has, and a test can read
// their output directly. `writeMisWorkbook` is the only code that knows ExcelJS
// exists, it is the same nine lines whatever is being exported, and spec §10.17
// pins it by loading its bytes back.
//
// (The source's Flash workbook, where its ExcelJS work began, is not ported:
// the Flash Dashboard stays in the MIS app — ADR 0005.)

 * "1,234,567.50", and writing those would hand Finance a spreadsheet it cannot
 * sum. Presentation belongs to `numFmt`, which Excel applies to a live number.
 *
 * A string is for text that is genuinely text — a row label, a region name, and
 * the `"N/A"` and `"%"` the ARR backend answers in cells it cannot compute.
 * `null` leaves the cell empty rather than writing a zero that would be read as
 * a figure.

   * nothing else does). The reader sees "98.25%", and a formula that multiplies
   * by the cell gets the right answer.
   *
   * Ticket 11 wrote these as a bare "98.25" under money's format instead, on
   * the reasoning that the screen shows them bare. Ticket 18 reversed that: a
   * percentage sitting in a column of money under money's format is a figure a
