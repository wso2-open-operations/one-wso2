 * long list is slow — every row is `columnGroups × subColumns` cells, and every

 * Periods asks 30,000 questions to show twenty lines. It does that again on

 *
 * ---- what is windowed, and what is not -------------------------------------
 *
 * Only the rows. The table, the two header rows and the pinned column are
 * untouched, and that is the whole design: the rows stay real `<tr>`s in a real
 * `<tbody>`, so the table algorithm still sizes the columns across header and
 * body, `position: sticky` still works on the label column, and the
 * `id`/`headers` wiring still resolves. What replaces the rows outside the
 * window is two empty rows carrying their height.
 *
 * `react-window` is a dependency here and cannot do this — see `rowWindow` for
 * the primary source. Ticket 07 asked for it to be tried first; it was.

 * Below `ROW_WINDOW_THRESHOLD` none of this runs and the table renders exactly

/**
 * How tall the first header row is, measured.

 * THE two-row-header problem, in one hook. `stickyHeader` pins every header
 * cell to `top: 0` — verified in @mui/material 7.3.4, `TableCell.js:145-151`,
 * where the offset is not configurable — so with two header rows the second
 * lands on top of the first and the Period labels disappear behind the Amount /
 * % Open pair that belongs to them. Row 2 needs `top: <height of row 1>`, MUI
 * offers no API for it, and there is no column-group primitive in the package
 * either.
 *
 * A constant would be wrong the first time anything moved: the density, the
 * font, a Period label long enough to wrap, or a reader at anything other than
 * 100% zoom, where the true height is fractional and rounding it leaves either
 * a hairline gap or an overlap. So it is measured, and used as measured.
 *
 * The measuring itself is `useMeasuredValue`'s, which is where the
 * `ResizeObserver`-under-jsdom reasoning now lives; this hook is the question
 * asked of it, and the paragraphs above are why the question has to be asked at
 * all rather than answered with a constant.
 *
 * The height is state, so settling it re-renders the table — once on mount, and
 * again whenever the header row genuinely changes size. That is bounded, and it
 * is why the windowing below is measured in RENDERS rather than in rows: every
 * such render asks the `cell` function for every figure on screen again, and
 * before windowing existed that meant every figure in the Build.
