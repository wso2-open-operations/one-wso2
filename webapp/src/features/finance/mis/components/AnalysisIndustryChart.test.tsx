// zero-height, zero-width box — so `ResponsiveContainer` renders NOTHING here
// and every assertion about a bar would pass vacuously against an empty SVG.
// Replacing it with a fixed box is the only way to see the marks at all. This
// is the first charted screen in the repo, so there is no precedent to follow;
// it becomes one.
