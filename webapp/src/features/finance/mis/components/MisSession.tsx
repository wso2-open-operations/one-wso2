// What every MIS screen shares and no MIS screen owns.
//
// A layout route rather than a wrapper inside `MisShell`, and the difference
// matters exactly once: each MIS screen renders its OWN shell, so a provider
// there is unmounted and remade on every navigation between them. `Scale` does
// not notice, because it reads its value back out of `localStorage`. The session
// Years Back is held in memory alone — deliberately, see
// `YearsBackSessionContext` — so a remount would forget it, and a reader who set
// three years on the Build would be back to five after a look at Flash.
//
// Only what actually needs the longer life belongs here. `Scale` stays in
// `MisShell`, where ticket 05 put it, because the shell is the honest scope for
// anything that survives on its own.
