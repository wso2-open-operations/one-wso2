//
// From the `Region Summary view` segmented control in `RegionSummaryTabs.js`,
// whose two options this keeps verbatim. Exit ARR is the source's default and
// is the default here.
//
// The two are one Table asked two ways: Exit ARR is each region's BALANCE at
// the column's date, split by business unit, and All ARR Metrics is each
// region's MOVEMENT over the column, narrowed to one business unit. So they do
// not share a body, a row builder or a cache entry — only their rows, which
// both take from the response.
//
// Component state rather than the address bar, like the Region Type control
// beside it and for the same reason: the source keeps it in the table's own
// state, so it reaches no link anyone holds, and moving it into the URL extends
// the contract ticket 02 pinned. `docs/ported-apps/mis.md` §11 carries the
// question for both controls at once.
