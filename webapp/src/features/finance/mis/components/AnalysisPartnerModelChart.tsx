// ARR by partner model — how much of the book is sold through Channel and how
// much Direct.
//
// ---- this is a PROPORTION BAR where the source draws a pie -----------------
//
// Deliberate, and it is the one form decision on this screen. The source's
// `PieChart` has exactly two slices, which the `dataviz` skill names outright as
// something not to draw ("Bad: a one-bar bar chart, or a 2-slice pie"), and its
// form table routes part-to-whole to a stacked bar, going horizontal for long
// names. Two segments in a circle make the reader compare angles to answer a
// question a single bar answers by length.
//
// It is also what the source ITSELF falls back to. When one model holds all the
// ARR its pie is replaced by hand with a single labelled bar
// (`ArrAnalysisDashboard.js:1901-1929`) — so the bar is already the shape this
// screen degrades to, and this generalises it rather than inventing one.
//
// No figure moves. ADR 0003 protects the numbers Finance reconciles column by
// column, and those are in the companion table below, to the cent.
//
// ---- colour is by ENTITY, never by rank ------------------------------------
//
// Channel is always slot 1 and Direct always slot 2, whichever is larger. A
// view where Direct overtakes Channel must not repaint both of them — that is
// the one rule that makes two screenshots comparable. The slots come from
// `chartPalette`, validated against this app's own surfaces in both modes.
