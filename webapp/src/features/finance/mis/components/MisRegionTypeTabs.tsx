// Which geography Exit ARR by Region cuts its rows by.
//
// From the `Region Type` segmented control in `RegionSummaryTabs.js`. It
// commits on click, like the Table and unit tabs above it, because it is not a
// narrowing of the report — it is a different cut of it, and the backend
// computes it (`isSalesRegionSummary` in the request body).
//
// ---- why this is not in the address bar ------------------------------------
//
// Every other control on this screen is in the URL; this one is not, and the
// asymmetry is deliberate rather than an omission. In the source it is
// component state that dies with the table, so it is not in the Applied set, it
// is not serialised, and no link anyone holds carries it. Putting it in the
// query string would be the port promising something the source never did, and
// it would have to be added to the URL contract ticket 02 pinned — including
// what an unrecognised value degrades to and what a stale link means. Worth its
// own decision rather than a side effect of building the table. Recorded as an
// open question in `docs/ported-apps/mis.md` §11.
//
// The consequence, stated plainly so nobody has to discover it: a reader who
// shares a Sub Region view sends a Sales Region one.
