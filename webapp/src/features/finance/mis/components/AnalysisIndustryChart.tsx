// ARR by industry — six named industries and whatever else the book holds.
//
// ---- horizontal bars, one hue ----------------------------------------------
//
// Two form decisions, both from the `dataviz` skill and both departures from the
// source's vertical `BarChart`.
//
// **Horizontal**, because the categories have long names. "Health Care and
// Social Assistance" does not fit under a vertical bar, which is why the source
// wraps its axis labels at sixteen characters with a hand-rolled `wrapAxisLabel`
// — a workaround for the axis being the wrong one. Turned sideways the names are
// simply read left to right.
//
// **One hue for every bar**, because these are NOMINAL categories and the
// measure is magnitude. Colouring each bar by its own value would double-encode
// what bar length already shows and spend the identity channel on nothing; the
// skill names that one outright ("Bad: a value-ramp on nominal categories").
// One series also means no legend box — the title names it.
//
// ---- and the thing this chart will NOT claim -------------------------------
//
// An industry the backend did not offer is never asked about, and gets no bar
// at all rather than a zero one. The source reports it as `revenue: 0`
// (`arrAnalysisApi.js:266-299`) and draws a zero bar, which states "this
// industry holds no ARR" on the strength of a question nobody put.
// `analysisBreakdowns.ts` keeps the two apart; this renders the distinction.
