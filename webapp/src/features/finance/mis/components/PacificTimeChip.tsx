// The permanent `Pacific Time (PST|PDT)` chip every MIS screen carries — spec §3.
//
// It is on screen always, not only when something looks odd, because the whole
// point is that nothing ever looks odd: a reader in Colombo opening a Build at
// 09:00 on 1 January sees last year's closing column and has no way to tell
// whether that is right. The chip is the only thing on the page that says the
// year was decided in California.
//
// The label comes from `pacificTimeLabel`, which is the same module the
// boundaries come from. That is the criterion in spec §10.9 and it is the
// reason there is no string constant here: a chip that said "PST" from its own
// source would be wrong for eight months of the year and would still be there,
// looking authoritative, beside dates that had moved.
export default function PacificTimeChip() {
  // ONE clock read, used twice. Two calls would be two instants, and the pair
  // that straddled a transition would put PST on the screen and PDT in the
  // accessible name — the exact drift this chip exists to rule out.
  //
  // Read at render. A session left open across a transition shows the old
  // abbreviation until something re-renders, which is a label an hour stale
  // rather than a figure wrong — not worth a timer.
