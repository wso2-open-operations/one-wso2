// The Applied filters as a strip of chips, under the controls that set them.
//
// A list rather than a row of buttons, because that is what it is: a reader on a
// screen reader hears "Applied filters, list, six items" and can step through
// what the figures above them have been narrowed by. The source built the same
// thing (`AppliedFilterChips.js`) and this keeps its semantics.
//
// The source also takes a `readOnly`, for a drill-down dialog that shows the
// filters it inherited without letting anyone change them from inside it. Not
// ported: that dialog is ticket 13's, and a flag with no caller is a guess about
// what it will want. Omitting `onRemove` already renders a strip nothing can
// dismiss, which may turn out to be all ticket 13 needs.
