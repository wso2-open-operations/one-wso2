// The Build table's style decisions, as data.
//
// They live here rather than inline for the reason `financeGridSx.ts` already
// records: jsdom does not resolve an emotion-injected rule through
// `getComputedStyle`, so a rendered assertion about a `:hover` or a sticky
// offset passes just as happily with the rule deleted. ADR 0004 lists three
// mechanisms this table has to own forever and none of them is decorative, so
// each one is a value a test can hold still — and `BuildTable.test.tsx` also
// checks that the component uses them, because a constant nothing reads is
// worth nothing.
//
// ---- why any of this is hand-rolled at all --------------------------------
//
// ADR 0004: the community `@mui/x-data-grid` this app ships cannot express a
// Build — no column pinning, no row grouping, `pageSize` throws above 100. So
// the table is a plain `<Table>`, and these are the pieces MUI then declines to
// provide.

 * tint would be a no-op on a balance row, which already rests at exactly that
 * colour: the pointer would cross the row a reader most wants to track and
