//                   Build, and `view.setWindow` owns everything that implies.
//   the unit tabs   commit on click. A different business unit is a different
//                   report, not a narrowing of this one.
//   the filters     are PENDING until APPLY. Narrowing is a sentence you finish

//                   fetch per column, so a bar that applied as you typed would

//                   which figures they are, so it takes effect at once and is
//                   remembered across screens (ticket 05).
//
// Everything here writes through `useMisViewState` (ticket 02). There is no
// second copy of the view: what APPLY does is put a filter set in the address,
