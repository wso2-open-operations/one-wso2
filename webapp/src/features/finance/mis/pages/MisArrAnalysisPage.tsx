// and loses the distinction this route needs.
//

// Still in flight, a redirect would bounce a bookmarked link on every cold
// load; failed, it would relocate someone because of a gateway blip and tell
// them nothing. Both are held by `MisShell`'s prerequisite rung instead.
//
// ---- where the Build's screens have a URL and this one does not ------------
//
// Every filter here is component state. The source's are too, so a shared link
// opens on defaults in both apps — reproduced under ADR 0003 rather than fixed,
// because extending the URL contract ticket 02 pinned is a contract decision
// and not a side effect of porting a table. Recorded as an open question in
