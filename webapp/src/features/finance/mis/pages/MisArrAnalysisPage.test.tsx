// Vitest's 5s default is the wrong one for this file: every test mounts the
// whole screen, which is a real DataGrid under a panel of real Autocompletes,
// and in jsdom under the full suite's parallelism that legitimately runs past

// timer or a network, so a timeout is always machine load rather than a hang.

// ARR Analysis's front door: a server-side flag on top of a privilege.
//
// The two refusals are deliberately DIFFERENT, and the difference is the whole
// design here:
//
//   the flag is off   the screen does not exist for anyone → REDIRECT to ARR
//                     Build, and no rail entry (misRail.test.tsx)
//   no privilege      the screen exists and this reader may not open it →
//                     a locked panel, like every other MIS URL
//
// A redirect asserts a fact about the app; a locked panel asserts one about the
// reader. Which means the two states where the flag is simply UNKNOWN — still
// in flight, or the call failed — can be neither. On a cold load a bookmarked
// link must not bounce before the answer arrives, and a gateway blip must not
// silently relocate someone with no explanation.
