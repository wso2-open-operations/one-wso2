/**
 * theme.ts:281-297 in the source app removes the grid's focus ring for cells,
 * column headers and rows. Ours took the MUI default, so clicking any cell in
 * a read-only grid outlined it as though something had been selected — and
 * nothing in these screens acts on a single cell.
 *
 * A rendered assertion was tried first and could not fail: jsdom does not
 * resolve an emotion-injected `:focus` rule through getComputedStyle, so the
 * test passed with the rule deleted. This checks the rule and its wiring
 * instead, which are the two things that can actually go wrong.
