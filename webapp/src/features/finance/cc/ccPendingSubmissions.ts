 *
 * All four are ports of source behaviour that is easy to get subtly wrong:
 * the sort order, the index-based product-unit lookup, which fields a change
 * invalidates, and the order a bulk edit applies its fields in.
 *
 * Completeness itself is NOT here — `ccTxnComplete` in ccTypes.ts already
 * mirrors `validateRequiredFields` (utils.ts:51-72) and is what the tick, the
 * submit gate and the approval screens all read. A second copy of that rule is
 * exactly the disparity this migration exists to avoid.
