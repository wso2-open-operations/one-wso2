// The company's reporting hierarchy, as a collapsible outline.
//
// Ported from the standalone org-chart app, whose canvas-and-pan-zoom UI is
// deliberately NOT carried over. Its original
// four-endpoint, lazy-per-manager backend contract isn't available either —
// this now reads the people-app backend's employee directory
// (useEmployeeDirectory) in one request and builds the whole tree client-side
// (buildOrgTree). The full functional spec, including why the interaction
// model changed, is in docs/ported-apps/org-chart.md — read that rather than
// reconstructing the rules from this file.
//
// Row visibility (`openEmails`) is lifted here so Expand all / Reset view can
// act on every row at once.
