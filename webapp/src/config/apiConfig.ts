//     never inspects the Asgardeo token itself, so the standard authedGet /
//     authedPost helpers work unmodified — no per-backend header quirk like
//     par-app's `x-user-timezone-offset`.

// GRC Platform — the Security perspective (Risk Hub, Audit Hub and Admin
// Console), lifted from grc-tools/apps/grc-platform.
//
// ONE THING ABOUT THIS BACKEND THAT NO SIBLING HERE SHARES: it verifies the
// token's `aud`, and each Asgardeo application mints its own. It used to accept
// a single AUTH_AUDIENCE — the GRC webapp's client id — so every request from
// here 401'd with `token has invalid audience`. That backend now takes a
// comma-separated set (grc-tools #82, merged and deployed), and AUTH_AUDIENCE
// names this app's client id too.
//
// Left here because the failure is otherwise unrecognisable: a 401 on EVERY
// Security call, including /me/privileges, while every other backend in this
// app works. If that comes back, check AUTH_AUDIENCE before anything else. A
// second IdP entry is NOT the fix — the backend's runtime map is keyed by
// issuer and both apps share one, so it would overwrite the first.
//
// CORS is not a factor either way, despite that backend's own
// middleware/cors.go allowing exactly one origin. It never reaches the browser:
// requests go through the Choreo gateway, which answers the preflight itself
// and reflects the caller's origin. Measured with an OPTIONS against stage. The
// Go middleware only matters to a browser hitting the service directly.
//
// These screens send THIS APP'S ACCESS TOKEN, like every other backend here —
// not the ID token the GRC source sends. See features/security/grc/shim.
//
// Named for the BACKEND (grc-platform), not for the perspective. The label on
// that perspective is a product decision that has already changed once —
// "Security" became "Security and Compliance" — and a config key that tracks a
// label goes stale the next time. The service, its Choreo component and its
// repo are all called grc-platform, so this name stays greppable across all
// three.
